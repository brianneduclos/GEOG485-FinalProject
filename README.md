# GEOG485-FinalProject
My final project for GEOG 485, GIS Programming and Software Development at Penn State University.

This tool takes a statewide DEM, clips it to 12-digit hydrologic units that intersect a county border, creates hillshade and slope rasters, and projects those rasters into a state standard projection. Included here are a Python script and an ArcGIS Pro script tool.
